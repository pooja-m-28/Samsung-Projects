Raspberry Pi IoT Projects Collection 🚀

This repository contains multiple beginner-to-intermediate level IoT projects built using Raspberry Pi, sensors, LEDs, and GPIO programming. These projects demonstrate hardware interfacing, automation logic, and real-time sensor control using Python.

These projects were developed as part of my IoT learning and practical implementation experience.

📁 Projects Included
1. LED Control (led.py)

Basic LED ON/OFF control using Raspberry Pi GPIO

Demonstrates digital output control

Useful for beginners to understand GPIO programming

Concepts: GPIO output, digital control

2. Button Control (Button.py)

Controls LED using a push button

Detects button press and triggers output action

Concepts: GPIO input, event detection, user input control

3. Motion Sensor System (motion sensor.py)

Uses PIR motion sensor to detect movement

Turns ON LED when motion is detected

Useful for security and automation systems

Concepts: PIR sensor, motion detection, automation

4. Distance Sensor with LED Indicator (Distance sensor.py)

Uses ultrasonic sensor to measure distance

LED indicates object proximity

Can be used in obstacle detection systems

Concepts: Ultrasonic sensor, distance measurement, real-time response
